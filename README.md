# Yongqin----machine-learning
This file contains some of the models that I built from scratch in a machine learning class.
Although these models are not sophisticated by any means (e.g., multiple linear regressions with ridge function and momentum,  classification with neural networks, etc),
they reflect my efforts and coding skills to a extent, therefore I want to share them with anyone who maybe interested.
Various datasets that I used to train the models are also provided (e.g., MNIST, Iris flower, etc)
