# Yongqin----machine-learning
This file contains models that I built from scratch in a machine learning class.
Although these models are quite basic (e.g., multiple linear regressions(with ridge function and momentum), edge detection, wine recognition, etc),
they reflect my efforts and coding skills to a extent, therefore I want to share them with anyone who maybe interested.
