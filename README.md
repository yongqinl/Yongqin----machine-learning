# machine-learning
This file contains some of the models that I built from scratch in a machine learning class (e.g., multiple linear regressions with ridge function and momentum,  classification with neural networks, etc).
They reflect my efforts and coding skills to a extent, therefore I want to share them with anyone who might be interested.
Various datasets that I used to train the models are also provided (e.g., MNIST, Iris flower, etc)
